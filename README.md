Zepp OS 2 - A deeper look into

This is a collection of texts and code examples that I have written as part of my "research" around Zepp-OS. To be honest, the original documentation of Zepp-OS2 is simply too incomplete for me. Above all, the API description and its lack of detailed documentation, which significantly complicates the entry into development with Zepp-OS 2, have prompted me to publish my own notes here.

This collection does not follow a didactic structure, but is simply a heap of text artifacts that have accumulated during my own studies around Zepp OS.

After an initial phase, I believe one could certainly consider to what extent these texts could be transferred into a kind of "Zepp-OS 101".

However, taking into account the already announced launch of Zepp-OS 3, I would definitely postpone these plans to the time "after" that.
